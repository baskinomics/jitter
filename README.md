# `jitter`

`jitter` is a CLI tool designed to check a developer's git repositories and report if they are in a clean state. The use case envisioned is to utilize `jitter` prior to migrating to a different physical machine or prior to a context switch in projects, where the tool reports on the status of a developer's git repositories at one time.
